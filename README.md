Pair programming competition entry by Jerry Mesim√§ki and Tommi Nikkanen

The goal was to create a Doodle-like web service in 8 hours from scratch. Our approach was that Doodle is way too heavy for quick use where you just want to find some common time between few people. This inspired us to create a minimal user experience where syncing schedules is easy. The visual look should guide the user to choose something that others have already voted for.

Stack: Ruby on Rails, jQuery, Tommi's mad CSS skills
